== Description ==
Show Category parents and sub categories of the same parent of the current post/page's category on the sidebar of a single post or a page or an archive, highlight the current subcategory the post is in
and unlike most of similar plugins out there, this one shows where the user is from, where he/she is and where to go
this is helpful for navigation and the overall user experience. Inspired by the problem i was facing when doing a client's site and i think many of you 
out there meet the same challenges
